I'm a lead engineer with a passion for building scalable software platforms that actually solve real-world problems. 
Over the past decade, I've guided teams across diverse sectors—from genomics and climate policy to digital health— helping transform complex technical challenges into elegant solutions using everything from Python and React to serverless architectures on AWS using Node.js. 
My PhD in physics taught me to think systematically, but it's the hands-on experience leading cross-functional teams and delivering products used in the real world that really drives my approach to engineering. 
When I'm not helping the team orchestrate CI/CD pipelines or optimizing database queries, you'll find me in my workshop crafting projects, painting watercolour landscapes, or training my dog—pursuits that keep me grounded and remind me that the best solutions, whether in code or life, come from patience, precision, and a willingness to iterate.
